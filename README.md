qlearner
========

A demonstration of the q-learning reinforcement learning technique. For more
information about the technique itself, see [its Wikipedia page][wiki].

This program uses the q-learning technique to move an agent through a grid.
There is a starting square and a goal square, and the agent has to
learn, using q-learning, how to reach the goal in the fewest number of moves.
The test code demonstrates how to set up this "Grid World"
