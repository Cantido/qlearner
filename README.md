qlearner
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Cantido/qlearner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Cantido/qlearner)

A demonstration of the q-learning reinforcement learning technique. For more
information about the technique itself, see [its Wikipedia page][wiki].

This program uses the q-learning technique to move an agent through a grid.
There is a starting square and a goal square, and the agent has to
learn, using q-learning, how to reach the goal in the fewest number of moves.

Usage
-----
See the `qlearner-core` module for the core library, or see the `gridworld` module
for an example implementation.
